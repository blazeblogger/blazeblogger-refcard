The BlazeBlogger Quick Reference Card  is distributed  as a  LaTeX2e source
code,  which means that in order to get a printable  document,  you have to
run it through the typesetting  system first.  To make this process as easy
as possible,  appropriate Makefile is included in the root directory of the
source package;  to produce the document in desired file format, use one of
the following commands:

  make pdf          # Create the card in Portable Document Format.
  make dvi          # Create the card in Device independent file format.
  make ps           # Create the card in PostScript.

Alternatively, you can perform respective actions manually.  To produce the
PDF file, type:

  pdflatex blazeblogger-refcard.tex

To produce the DVI file, run:

  latex blazeblogger-refcard.tex

Finally, to convert already created DVI to PostScript, use:

  dvips -t a4 -t landscape blazeblogger-refcard.dvi
